	We hang out on an IRC chat channel: #activequant on {{{irc://irc.othernet.org}irc.othernet.org}}.  
	
	Our IRC chat logs are located at {{{http://activequant.org/irclog}IRCLOG}}. 
	
	There is a developer and support forum at {{{http://developers.activequant.org/projects/aq2o/boards}http://developers.activequant.org/projects/aq2o/boards}} - not much going on there, we relaunched our dev site a while ago. The old forum archives are still around, but switched off to direct all requests to the new forum.
