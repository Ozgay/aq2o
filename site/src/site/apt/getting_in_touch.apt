Getting in touch with the group

	For a less personal contact with the group (not through Ulrich), follow these two links: 
	
	We hang out on an IRC chat channel: #activequant on irc.othernet.org 
	
	There is a developer and support forum at http://developers.activequant.org/projects/aq2o/boards - not much going on there, we relaunched our dev site a while ago. The old forum archives are still around, but switched off to direct all requests to the new forum.
