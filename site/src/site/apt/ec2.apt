ActiveQuant and Amazon EC2

	We have successfully deployed an entire infrastructure (database, hadoop/hbase, activemq, ActiveQuant pricefeed and ActiveQuant datarecorder and ActiveQuant trading system) 
	inside Amazon's EC2 cloud. Pretty impressive was the processor power scaling feature of EC2.   
	
	We also mounted block storage from Amazon, so that the disc can scale quickly. 
	
	Contact us if you would like to have a copy of the snapshot.
