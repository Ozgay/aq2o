These classes contain the interfaces for the DAO layer. 
The various domain model objects must be accessed and loaded through the DAO layer. 
Note that the underlying DAO implementation is shielded from the user (and vice versa) 
and may change without notice. 

Use the IDaoFactory interface to receive instances of classes that implement for example
IMarketDataInstrumentDao, ICountryDao, etc.
