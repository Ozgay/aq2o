What you can do ...

	... to help us. 
	
	First of all, use ActiveQuant, provide feedback and submit patches or source code. Tell people that you use ActiveQuant. In case you make a huge pile 
	of cash from trading with ActiveQuant, remember our license - it's not an do-as-thou-please license. 
	
	Second of all, buy consulting from us.
	
	If you volunteer and provide feedback and if it proves valuable, you can be sure that there will be a flow back to you.
