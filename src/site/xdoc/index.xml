    <section name="Typical use cases">
    <p>
	Typical use cases for this project include recording large volume timeseries, managing financial reference data and other information. 
	You can also backtest and run trading systems in production.  
	You might also want to plug in applications written in other languages through 
	a SOAP Service Facade or Matlab to access that data. It is also possible simulate trading, high frequency and low frequency and to move seamlessly from simulation to production through one of the trading venue interface implementations.

    <section name="How does the GUI look like?">
    <p>
    Sooner or later, you will want to have a GUI to trade and run things. Here is how it looks like. The GUI is available as a commercial add-on.

    <section name="A personal message">
    <p>
    This framework follows the KISS principle as close as possible. In case you wonder why something was done that way and not another, keep KISS in mind. 
	</p><p>
	Another topic, checkstyle. Use it as a hint, but don't take it serious. Things like whitespace warnings and hiding variable names in constructors are something for interns that have nothing else to do. If you have some time, clean things up.   
	</p><p>
	Use this framework in simulation as long as you need to and purchase one of the external interfaces to link it to the real world. Of course you are free to distribute and publish your own external connectors, if you let something flow back to us. Please keep our license in mind.
