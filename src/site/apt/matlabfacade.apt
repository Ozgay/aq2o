Matlab facade

	The matlab facade offers very convenient methods to matlab users for accessing the functionality within the activequant framework, such as the archive, reference data or simulation functionality. Actually it is a Java class with several convenience methods, which can be used from within Matlab due to the superior Java integration in ML.  

	To use it, put the AQ Framework jar (filename: activequant-framework-2.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar) into the STATIC classpath, not the dynamic classpath, of your matlab. When that is done, you can use and access the matlab facade and also all other parts of AQ. 

	Once you are done with the installation, have a look at the following example that should make some things a bit clearer. 

+--------------+
% define some constants for later, easier use
EOD = com.activequant.domainmodel.TimeFrame.EOD;
INTERPOLRULE =  com.activequant.matlab.Parameter.INTERPOLRULE;
DAYRULE =  com.activequant.matlab.Parameter.DAYRULE;
INTERPOLRULE_CARRY_FORWARD = com.activequant.matlab.InterpolationRule.CARRY_FORWARD;
DAYRULE_WEEKDAYS = com.activequant.matlab.DayRule.WEEKDAYS;

% instantiate the service facade. 
msf = com.activequant.matlab.MatlabServiceFacade();
paramMap = java.util.HashMap()

% fetch time series data 
array = msf.fetchTSData(com.activequant.domainmodel.TimeFrame.EOD,  ...
    {'CSI_JPL', 'CSI_EURUSD'}, ... 
    {'OPEN', 'HIGH', 'LOW', 'CLOSE'}, ... 
    20000101000000.0, paramMap);        

% fetch time series data with an interpolation rule. 
paramMap.put(INTERPOLRULE, INTERPOLRULE_CARRY_FORWARD);    
paramMap.put(DAYRULE, DAYRULE_WEEKDAYS);    

array = msf.fetchTSData(com.activequant.domainmodel.TimeFrame.EOD,  ...
    {'CSI_AD', 'CSI_EURUSD'}, ... 
    {'CLOSE'}, ... 
    20000701000000.0, 20000710000000.0, paramMap);

+--------------+

	In case your hbase server does not reside on localhost, which is very likely, you can specify the host ip or dns name as a parameter in the constructor of the matlab facade. 
	This would then look like follows: 

+-----------+
msf = com.activequant.matlab.MatlabServiceFacade('your.zookeeper.com');
+-----------+

	Feel free to add new methods to the facade or to request new functionality through our bug tracker.
