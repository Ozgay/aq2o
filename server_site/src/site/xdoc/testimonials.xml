		  "<strong>I couldn't be happier with my ActiveQuant server.</strong> Its not just stable, its rock solid, easily coping with the 1500 messages a second we see in peaks. Data is quick and easy to access. The database is massively scaleable and the package doesnt have a huge hardware requirement, nor does it require you to purchase licenses from multiple vendors to run it. I looked at multiple alternatives to ActiveQuant, none could offer close to the same value proposition. Ulrich has my contact details, I'm happy to answer questions" - <i><strong>John F.</strong></i></p>
