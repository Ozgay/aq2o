Service Facades

	Service Facades are classes that provide use case oriented methods for other systems. They are essential in a service oriented architecture (SOA). Details about SOA can be found on {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture}Wikipedia}} or in any good book on software architecture.

	AQ's service facades are at the time of this writing relatively lean, but functional. Feel free to extend these classes and to submit new code.
