Licensing

	ActiveQuant is distributed under a commercial friendly dual licensing model. The base framework is distributed free of charge to students, academics and hobbyists. If you reach a revenue between 100'000 USD and 1'000'000 USD  per annum from your trading, based on ActiveQuant, you have to pay ONCE 8% to us. All above 1'000'000 USD is fully for you and everything under 100'000 USD is fully for you, too. For example, if you make 500k USD revenue, you owe us 40k USD. So, yes, you could declare in the first year only 99k and not pay anything -  but would that show your good manners? We think our offer is fair, given the amount of time we spent into this project over the years and the amount of cash you make. You can be sure that all cash in-flow will go straight into the ongoing development of ActiveQuant and given there is cash left, into the open source projects we depend on. 

	We take good care that we do not breach any licenses and that we do not derive work from other open source projects. We use only Apache license projects if possible. 

	Please notice that we do not grant you the right to derive work, reuse parts, concepts or ideas in your project unless you explicitly mention ActiveQuant. In case you resell software which is based on ActiveQuant, the same rules apply as to trading revenues. 

	In case of doubt or if you want to discuss this, please don't hesitate to contact {{{mailto:ustaudinger@activequant.com}Ulrich}}.
