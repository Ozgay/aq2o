<h1>Trading User Interface</h1>
<p>The trading user interface is a JAVA WebStart application. You
	need to have Java 1.7x installed. Click the following link. Should you
	be asked if you want to run this application, confirm.</p>
<p>The first start could require a full download of all
	dependencies. This might take a minute or two. Consecutive starts will
	be much quicker.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that this trading GUI is not a replacement of
	your ISV's trading GUI, but a customizable supplement.</p>
