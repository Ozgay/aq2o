<h3>Trading</h3>
<p>
Trading related data and trading functionality is a corner stone of any automated trading house. 
How do you want to trade without market access? 
</p>
<p>Luckily your have the solution right in front of your eyes.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
Trading and trading data connectors are components which are attached to your AQMS&trade;. 
They can send and receive messages. Trading connectors behave in a well defined way, abstracting and unifying
the trading related messages in use at different brokerage houses. Instead of having to maintain five different connectors
for four different FIX dialects and one non-fix dialect, you use the unified protocol AQMS&trade; protocol to do cross-market-place arbitrage.    
</p>
<p>Some of our connectors are available for free, while others are sold for an annual fee.
