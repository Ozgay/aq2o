<h1>Market data</h1>
<p>
Market data is the heart and soul of your trading decisions. Luckily you made the right choice and check out the ActiveQuant Master Server.
Build on a rock solid, scalable architecture and access it from R, Matlab, .NET or any other language you would like to use. We use easy-to-implement communication protocols which get you connected in a snap.

Because of a clear distinction of market data between providers, you won't have to think about where data is from: all MarketDataInstrument IDs are provider specific.
